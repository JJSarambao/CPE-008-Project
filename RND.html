    <p id = "starttext">Engineering is evolving everyday due to the power of Research. The New technologies that we use and those out-of-this-world designs that we see, are not built by engineering alone. Research is done first in order to know the feasibility of a New Feature or Project. And there are Institutes, Facilities, and Companies that are built especially for Research and Development. Here are some of them. Tip: Click on their names to have you redirect to their respective websites!</p>
